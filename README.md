# Genesis Simple Hook Guide
Find Genesis action hooks quick and easily by seeing their actual locations inside your theme.

## Description
This is a simplified version of [Genesis Visual Hook Guide](https://wordpress.org/plugins/genesis-visual-hook-guide/) by Christopher Cochran with the following changes:

- Hooks are dynamically generated vs being hardcoded
- Clicking anywhere on a hook selects the hook name ready to be easily copied
- Does not show filters and markup

Once installed, this plugin adds a dropdown menu to the admin bar to see the available hooks on the page being viewed in the front end.
